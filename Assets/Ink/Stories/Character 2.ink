The next client is a woman named Olivia, from what I can gather she's lived a pretty uneventful life so usually we'd be able to send them up without bothering you #name:Receptionist
only thing is a few years before her death she stole something, and doesn't seem willing to confess to what it was, which is where you come in.#name:Receptionist
While this client speaks, you'll have some insight into her thoughts, but only enough to glean useful information from yes or no questions.#name:Receptionist
You're also limited to the amount of times you can use this, choose your questions wisely#name:Receptionist
I'll send her in now. #name:Receptionist
What... where am I now?#name:Olivia
You're here to be questioned by me instead, seeing how cooperative you've been when questioned by others#name:
